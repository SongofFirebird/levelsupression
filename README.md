# levelsupression
This is a Script create a levelsupressor on a Raspberry Pi with a DAC+ ADC Soundcard from Hifiberry.

It will install pulseaudio and configurate some necessary files.

The plan was to make the installation so easy as possible. The commands
install pulse audio, some plugins, configurate the pulseaudio
control file and the boot file. Also it turns off the power management.

It should be very easy to use, just download the script with "git clone 'git-link'" and
run it with "sudo bash ./levelsupression/installer.sh".
