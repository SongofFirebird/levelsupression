# levelsupression
This is a Script to install pulseaudio and add some lines in a file.

The plan was to make the installation so easy as possible. The commands
install pulse audio and some plugins and configurate the pulseaudio
control file.

It is very easy tu use, just download it with "git clone 'git-link' " and
run it with "sudo bash ./levelsupression/installer.sh".
